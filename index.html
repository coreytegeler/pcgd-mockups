			The Purchase College graphic design department offers a distinctive community in the art and practice of print and digitally based graphic design and experimental publishing. The program teaches students to solve visual communication problems with words, symbols, and image blocks through commercial, political, educational, literary, subversive, personal, and experimental applications. Our faculty members are practicing professional artists with significant exhibition records and prestigious awards. The department's alumni pursue careers in galleries and museums, national publications, art direction, education, and graduate study and research, and as independent, exhibiting studio artists.
